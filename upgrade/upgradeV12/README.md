# Upgrade V12 - Multi-Contract Upgrade

Script for upgrading four critical contracts in the Polygon ecosystem:

1. **AgglayerManager** - Core rollup management contract
2. **AgglayerGateway** - AggLayer gateway contract for cross-chain operations
3. **AgglayerBridge** - Bridge contract for asset transfers
4. **AgglayerGER** - Global exit root manager

## Overview

This upgrade script performs a coordinated upgrade of all four contracts using a batch timelock operation, ensuring atomic execution and maintaining system consistency.

## Files

- `upgradeV12.ts` - Main upgrade script that deploys implementations and creates timelock operations
- `upgradeV12.test.ts` - Shadow fork test validating all contract upgrades
- `upgrade_parameters.json` - Configuration parameters for the upgrade
- `upgrade_parameters.json.example` - Example configuration file
- `upgrade_output.json` - Generated output after running the upgrade script (created after execution)

## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup

1. **Install packages**

```bash
npm i

}
```

### Parameters Description

#### Mandatory Parameters

- `tagSCPreviousVersion`: GitHub tag of the previous smart contracts version (for documentation)
- `rollupManagerAddress`: Address of the AgglayerManager proxy contract to upgrade (other contract addresses will be automatically obtained from this contract)
- `timelockDelay`: Delay in seconds between schedule and execution (minimum 3600 seconds recommended)
- `initializeAgglayerGateway`: Parameters for AgglayerGateway initialization:
    - `multisigRole`: Address to grant multisig role permissions (cannot be zero address)
    - `signersToAdd`: Array of SignerInfo objects with `addr` (address) and `url` (string) properties (must be valid addresses, no duplicates, non-empty URLs, max 255 signers)
    - `newThreshold`: Minimum number of signatures required for multisig operations (must be ≤ number of signers, > 0 if signers present)

**Note**: The addresses for `aggLayerGatewayAddress`, `bridgeV2Address`, and `globalExitRootV2Address` are automatically obtained from the RollupManager contract.

#### Optional Parameters

- `timelockSalt`: Unique salt for timelock operations (defaults to ethers.ZeroHash)
- `maxFeePerGas`: Maximum fee per gas unit (optional, for EIP-1559 transactions)
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Maximum priority fee per gas (optional, for EIP-1559 transactions)
- `multiplierGas`: Gas multiplier with 3 decimals (e.g., "1500" for 1.5x)
- `timelockAdminAddress`: Address with timelock admin privileges (auto-detected if not provided)
- `unsafeMode`: Boolean flag to disable critical tooling checks (default: false, ⚠️ only for development/testing)

#### Fork Parameters (for testing)

- `forkParams.rpc`: RPC URL for shadow fork testing
- `forkParams.network`: Network name ("mainnet" or "sepolia")

## Usage

### 1. Deploy Implementations

Run the upgrade script to deploy new implementations and generate timelock operations:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./upgrade/upgradeV12/upgradeV12.ts --network sepolia
```

**Optional: Unsafe Mode**

To disable critical tooling checks, set `"unsafeMode": true` in `upgrade_parameters.json`:

```json
{
    "tagSCPreviousVersion": "v1.0.0",
    "rollupManagerAddress": "0x...",
    "timelockDelay": 3600,
    "unsafeMode": true,
    "..."
}
```

**Verification Tracking**

The script automatically tracks contract verification on Etherscan and includes results in the output JSON.

⚠️ **Warning**: Setting `"unsafeMode": true` disables critical tooling checks including:

- Git tag validation (ensures deployment matches tagged version)
- Repository state verification
- Critical deployment safeguards

Only use `unsafeMode: true` for development/testing purposes. **Never use in production deployments.**

This will:

**Deploy and verify new implementations:**

- AgglayerManager implementation
- AgglayerGateway implementation
- AgglayerBridge implementation
- AgglayerGER implementation
- Bridge auxiliary contracts (BytecodeStorer, TokenWrapper, BridgeLib)

**Validate AgglayerGateway initialization parameters:**

- Ensures multisigRole is not zero address
- Validates all SignerInfo objects have valid structure (addr + url properties)
- Ensures all signer addresses are valid and unique
- Validates all URLs are non-empty strings
- Checks threshold constraints (≤ signers count, > 0 if signers present)
- Enforces maximum signer limit (255)

**Generate timelock operations:**

- Batch schedule data for all four contract upgrades
- Batch execute data for atomic execution
- Decoded operation details for transparency

**Create output file:**

- `upgrade_output.json` with all deployment addresses and transaction data

### 2. Execute Upgrade

After running the deployment script:

1. **Schedule the batch upgrade:**

    ```bash
    # Use the scheduleData from upgrade_output.json
    # Send transaction to timelock contract
    ```

2. **Wait for timelock delay:**

    ```bash
    # Wait for the configured timelockDelay period
    # Monitor the timelock contract for readiness
    ```

3. **Execute the batch upgrade:**
    ```bash
    # Use the executeData from upgrade_output.json
    # Send transaction to timelock contract
    ```

### 3. Validate Upgrade

Run the shadow fork test:

```bash
npx hardhat test ./upgrade/upgradeV12/upgradeV12.test.ts --network hardhat
```

The test performs:

**Network Setup:**

- Forks the target network at deployment block
- Impersonates timelock admin account
- Funds accounts for transaction execution

**Upgrade Execution:**

- Simulates timelock schedule transaction
- Fast-forwards time to bypass delay
- Executes the batch upgrade atomically

**Validation:**

- ✅ Verifies all 4 contracts upgraded to v1.2.0
- ✅ Validates all storage variables preserved
- ✅ Confirms auxiliary contracts deployed correctly
- ✅ Tests re-initialization protection
- ✅ Validates cross-contract references maintained

## Contract Upgrade Details

### 1. AgglayerManager

- **Function:** Core rollup management and sequencing
- **Upgrade Type:** `upgrade` (simple proxy upgrade, no re-initialization)
- **Key Validations:** Batch fees, emergency state, rollup counts, aggregation timestamps

### 2. AgglayerGateway

- **Function:** Cross-chain communication and AggLayer integration
- **Upgrade Type:** `upgradeAndCall` with re-initialization (reinitializer(2))
- **Initialize Parameters:** multisigRole, signersToAdd, newThreshold
- **Key Validations:** Gateway version

### 3. AgglayerBridge

- **Function:** Asset bridging and token management
- **Upgrade Type:** `upgrade` (simple proxy upgrade, no re-initialization)
- **Key Validations:** Bridge version, token implementations, gas token settings, deposit counts
- **Auxiliary Contracts:** BytecodeStorer, TokenWrapper, BridgeLib

### 4. AgglayerGER

- **Function:** Global state root management for cross-chain operations
- **Upgrade Type:** `upgrade` (simple proxy upgrade, no re-initialization)
- **Key Validations:** GER version, bridge reference, rollup manager reference

## Security Considerations

### Timelock Protection

- All upgrades executed through timelock with configurable delay
- Batch execution ensures atomicity across all contracts
- Admin roles verified before execution

### Storage Validation

- Storage layout compatibility checked by OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin
- Critical storage variables validated before and after upgrade
- Emergency rollback procedures documented

### Contract Verification

- All implementations automatically verified on Etherscan
- Constructor arguments validated and documented
- Deployment addresses recorded for transparency

### Testing Coverage

- Shadow fork testing on actual network state
- All contract interactions tested end-to-end
- Storage preservation validated
- Re-initialization protection verified

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Storage Layout Conflicts**

    ```
    Error: Storage layout incompatible
    Solution: Review storage changes, consider using unsafeSkipStorageCheck for testing only
    ```

2. **Timelock Permission Issues**

    ```
    Error: Timelock admin address does not have proposer/executor role
    Solution: Verify timelockAdminAddress has correct roles or leave empty for auto-detection
    ```

3. **Network Fork Issues**

    ```
    Error: Forked block is lower than implementation deploy block
    Solution: Ensure RPC supports historical data, wait for block synchronization
    ```

4. **Gas Estimation Problems**
    ```
    Error: Transaction underpriced
    Solution: Adjust maxFeePerGas/maxPriorityFeePerGas or increase multiplierGas
    ```

### Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file contains:

```env
# Deployment account
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Network access
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id

# Contract verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key

# Optional: Custom RPC endpoints
